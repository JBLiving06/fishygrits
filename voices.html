    <img src="/images/voices.png" alt="A painterly image of an empty wooden rocking chair on a Lowcountry porch, angled as if someone has just left or is about to return. A wooden cane rests against the arm of the chair. A small, vintage radio sits on the porch rail. An open Bible, with its pages gently rustling as if from a breeze, lies on the seat of the rocking chair. Warm afternoon light casts long, soft shadows across the porch, highlighting the haint blue painted ceiling. Palmetto plants and a live oak tree are in the soft-focus background. The scene evokes a sense of quiet presence and memory.">

        <p>The elders speak in a rhythm the microphones barely catch: porch pace, praise-house tempo, the long vowel of a Sea Island evening. When I say "Voices from the Porch," I'm talking about the people who kept the watch night, lined the hymn, cooked the repast, crossed the bridge and came back so the children would still know the tune. These oral histories are not museum dioramas; they're living testimonies—Deacon Smalls explaining how a praise meeting moves, Miss Gadson raising "Adam in de Garden," Aunt Pearlie Sue pulling a memory till it shines. I want you to hear the grain of the voices and the room around them—the truck idling, the choir changing keys, the scrape of a folding chair—because that's the classroom. This collection gathers recordings from St. Helena Island and Charleston kitchens and sanctuaries, where elders tell exactly how it was done and why it still matters. Pull up a seat on the porch, and let the cadence do its work.</p>
