    <img src="/images/hero.png" alt="A welcoming Lowcountry porch at dusk, viewed from the yard. The porch ceiling is painted haint blue. Two wooden rocking chairs are visible, one with an open Bible resting on its seat. Warm lamp light glows softly from inside the house through a screen door. A small table on the porch holds a pitcher of sweet tea and two glasses. A live oak tree draped with Spanish moss frames the left side of the composition. A misty marsh or tidal creek is in the soft-focus background, all rendered with a painterly, golden hour glow.">

        <p>FishyGrits is a purpose-built cultural space rooted in Southern Black life and church tradition. It began as an idea for a site featuring essays, but it has grown into something broader: a living place where memory, foodways, faith, houses, and voices are gathered, honored, and made useful now.</p>
        
        <p>Where I'm from, a fish fry isn't just food—it's covenant. Haint blue isn't just paint—it's protection. The porch isn't just a place to sit—it's where the elders speak and the children learn to listen. This site curates the work that's already happening across the web: oral histories, recipes, sermons, music, scholarship, and practice.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not performing. I'm witnessing and gathering. Come on in.</p>

A window with a delicate lace curtain adds a touch of interior warmth. A straw broom leans bristles-up beside a door, a traditional protective practice. A sweetgrass basket hangs near the door, and small, clear glass bottles are embedded in a nearby tree, illustrating the bottle tree tradition.

A wooden cane rests against the arm of the chair. A small, vintage radio sits on the porch rail. An open Bible, with its pages gently rustling as if from a breeze, lies on the seat of the rocking chair. Warm afternoon light casts long, soft shadows across the porch, highlighting the haint blue painted ceiling. Palmetto plants and a live oak tree are in the soft-focus background.
