        <p>Where I'm from, a fish fry isn't an event so much as a covenant. We work all week in a world that doesn't always love us back, then gather around a pot of hot oil to remember who we are. In the church kitchen or on the gravel beside the fellowship hall, somebody's auntie is dusting whiting in cornmeal, and somebody's deacon is laying out white bread, hot sauce, and paper towels like liturgy. When I say "fish and grits," I mean whiting—thin, sweet, fried crisp in a cornmeal crust—set next to creamy, buttered grits that hold the heat while the stories stretch long. These fries raise money for building funds and youth trips, but they also raise spirits, stitch neighborhoods, and teach our children the choreography of belonging: speak, serve, sit, pass, laugh, clean, and carry someone else's load home in foil. This is not food tourism. It's communal practice—sacred, ordinary, repeating—as sure as Friday comes each week. In "Fish Fries and Fellowship" you'll find proof: elders stewarding memory, kitchens financing freedom, recipes that taste like a porch at dusk, and histories that explain why a plate of fish can feel like a hymn. Come on in; the grease is ready.</p>

            <p>At Penn Center on St. Helena Island, a fundraising fish fry turns a plate into protection—raising money to defend Gullah land while celebrating the culture that made it. Local partners work the line like a liturgy—Gullah Project, Marshview Community Organic Farm, Gullah Grub—reminding us that cornmeal and hot oil can be civic infrastructure. This is Lowcountry mutual aid in its native tongue: feed the people, fund the future, keep the heritage.</p>

            <p>Soapstone's monthly fish fry kept an historic Black church alive for 22 years—then sent it forward with a schoolhouse restored and a monument raised. You can feel the theology of "loaves and fishes" in the line out the door and the joy on Miss Mable's face. Fundraising here is fellowship made visible.</p>
